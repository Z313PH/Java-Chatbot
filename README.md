# Java-Chatbot


## Overview
This project demonstrates a Java-based chatbot that employs parallel computing and the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm to efficiently manage and respond to user queries. By leveraging advanced algorithmic computation and Java's concurrency framework, this chatbot offers an exemplary use case of real-time, interactive systems optimization.

## Features
- **Levenshtein Distance Algorithm**: Utilizes this algorithm to match user queries with the most relevant answers from a QA library, ensuring high accuracy.
- **Parallel Computing**: Implements Java's concurrency features to handle multiple user queries simultaneously, enhancing the throughput and responsiveness of the chatbot.
- **Efficient Query Handling**: Demonstrates the effective use of algorithmic computations in real-time applications through swift execution across multiple threads.

## Technologies
- Java
- Parallel Computing
- Levenshtein Distance Algorithm
